# Gluey

Gluey is a super simple sticky notes app built with rust and GTK

Note: Gluey does not support multiple windows simultaneously. if you try and open
gluey twice with the same config file, it will close immediately with some info
printed to stderr.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Z-snails/gluey.git
cargo install --path gluey
```
